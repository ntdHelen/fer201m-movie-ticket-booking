# Movie Ticket Booking

This project is an assignment for subject FER201m, semester 5, at FPT University.

A movie ticket booking website is a convenient online ticket booking platform that aims to provide customers with a list of movies, detailed information about a movie, such as movie title, genre, director, movie duration, a short video with a brief introduction to the movie, showtimes, available seats, and ticket prices. From there, users can freely choose movies and book tickets from anywhere without going to the cinema directly, providing flexibility in customers' pre-scheduled plans.
